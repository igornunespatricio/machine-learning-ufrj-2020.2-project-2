# machine-learning-ufrj-2020.2-project-2
Second project of the discipline Machine Learning in UFRJ, where a dataset of gray images of the surface of Venus where used to classificate with respect to presence of vulcanoes.

There is some pre-processing of the images and then random forest model was used to make predictions.

Standard libraries used were pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn. For image processing scikit-image was used. And for random forest models scikit-learn was used.
